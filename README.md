👋 Hi, I’m Dave

- 👀 I’m interested in a plethora of things, ranging from Web Development, Video Game Development, and optimisation of all kinds of processes.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning various languages to a more advanced degree, in hopes to get a tech-related job in the future. Currently, I could do with literally any industry experience.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I have a personal interest in. This will typically involve things that will make my own user experience better and more convenient. I hope to use this as a way to learn new things, and develop the experience needed to understand various kinds of code.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Due to optimisation being a big thing I love to do, I have hobbies that span in countless areas. From programming, to puzzles, to database design, to video games! I absolutely LOVE optimising things!

- 🖥 I have been coding (casually) for the last 10 years, ranging from Python, Java, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, jQuery, OOP (Unity & some other). If I were to estimate, I have likely spent over 7000 hours coding in total, and this is excluding research, books, tutorials and such.

- 📝 Thanks to academics, and it being my hobby, I'm able to quickly learn and pick up pretty much anything that's required of me. However, I'm obviously no match for a professional. At least not yet! I'm very patient, so I'm willing to work towards this no matter how many years it takes.

- 📢 If you are an employer looking to hire, I am UK-based. If you are located <20 miles from Manchester, particularly West of Manchester, commute may be possible for me. Full remote work is preferred, but not essential for me.
