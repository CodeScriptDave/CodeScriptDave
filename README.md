- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeScriptDave
- 👀 I’m interested in a plethora of things, ranging from Web Development, Video Game Development, and optimisation of all kinds of processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various languages to a more advanced degree, in hopes to get a tech-related job in the future, no matter how much I'll be earning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I have a personal interest in. This will typically involve things that will make my own user experience better and more convenient.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Due to optimisation being a big thing I love to do, I have hobbies that span in countless areas. From programming, to puzzles, to video games, to database design.
