- 👋 **Hi,** I’m @CodeScriptDave
- 👀 **I’m interested in a plethora of things,** ranging from Web Development, Video Game Development, and optimisation of all kinds of processes.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning various languages to a more advanced degree,** in hopes to get a tech-related job in the future. Currently, I could do with literally any industry experience.
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I have a personal interest in.** This will typically involve things that will make my own user experience better and more convenient. _I hope to use this as a way to learn new things,_ and develop the experience needed to understand various kinds of code.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Due to optimisation being a big thing I love to do, I have hobbies that span in countless areas. From programming, to puzzles, to database design, to video games! _I absolutely LOVE optimising things!_
- 📢 **If you are an employer looking to hire,** I am UK-based. If you are located <20 miles from Manchester, particularly West of Manchester, commute may be possible for me.  
- 🖥 **I have been coding (casually) for the last 10 years,** ranging from Python, Java, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, jQuery, OOP (Unity & Roblox Studio). If I were to estimate, I have likely spent over 7000 hours coding in total, and this is excluding research, books, tutorials and such.
- 📝 **Thanks to academics, and it being my hobby,** I'm able to quickly learn and pick up pretty much anything that's required of me. However, I'm obviously no match for a professional. At least not yet! I'm very patient, so I'm willing to work towards this no matter how many years it takes.
