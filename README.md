- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeScriptDave
- 👀 I’m interested in a plethora of things, ranging from Web Development, Video Game Development, and optimisation of all kinds of processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various languages to a more advanced degree, in hopes to get a tech-related job in the future. I'm pretty cheap since I could do with literally any industry experience right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I have a personal interest in. This will typically involve things that will make my own user experience better and more convenient.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Due to optimisation being a big thing I love to do, I have hobbies that span in countless areas. From programming, to puzzles, to video games, to database design.
- If you are an employer looking to hire, I am UK-based. If you are located <20 miles from Manchester, particularly West of Manchester, commute may be possible for me.  
- Been coding (casually) for the past 10 years, ranging from Python, Java, C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, jQuery, OOP (Unity & Roblox Studio).
- Due to my casual programming hobby, I'm able to quickly learn and pick up pretty much anything that's required of me, however obviously I'm no match for a professional.
